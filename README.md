# ANM Verona

## Data
- `FCmaps` are the mean maps, one for each subject
- `FCmaps_augmented` contains 10 maps for each subject
- `FCmaps_processed` contains the processed maps, one for each subject
- `FCmaps_processed`_augmented contains the processed maps, 10 for each subject.

### Dataset containing
- ID of the subject
- The diagnosis (Group)
- Sex
- Age
- Education

The regressors:
- CDR_SB: disease gravity with a larger range
- MMSE: Mini Mental Status
- (CDR: same but smaller range)

The subject 4_S_5003 is removed

### GMM on CDR_SB
- Assigning each CDB_SB value to a cluster using GMM, removing NaN values of the CDR_SB before
- New column for the metadata dataframe

### Preprocessing
- Aligning the metadata to the raw_df
- Optional threshold for values below 0.1 and 0.2
- Masking with 2 masks

- Possible output dataset:
- `df_thr01_gm_masked`
- `df_thr02_gm_masked`
- `df_thr01_har_masked`
- `df_thr02_har_masked`
- `df_gm_masked`
- `df_har_masked`

## Analysis
### Unsupervised clustering
- About the **input**
    - DataFrame that have been processed
    - The metadata
    - Possibility to save the plot
    - Title of the 2 plots, embeddings and clustering
    - Possibility to plot
    - Possibility to evaluate the clustering
    - Possibility to save the plot of the clustering
- **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction
- **Clustering**
- Clustering evalaution
- Plots

The UMAP and clustering ww have different paths:
- UMAP (2 dimensions)
    1. on the FDC maps
    2. on the Yeo Networks
- Clustering
    1. on UMAP + FDC
    2. on UMAP + Yeo Networks

### Linear regression
- About the input
    - DataFrame that have been processed
    - The metadata
    - Target variable that weâ€™ll be regressed
    - Covariates
    - Possibility to log transform the target
    - Possibility to plot ==> save the plot in a different directory if you change the target variable
    - Possibility to save the plot
    - Prefix for title and path
- Again the subjects witout the target are removed
- UMAP for dimensionality reduction
- Fit OLS model
- Shuffling regression
- Results are printed
